Given weatherData.csv, which contains 10 years of daily weather observations from multiple locations across Austrailia, predict whether it will rain tomorrow or not. 
The data contains temperature, humidity, wind speed, and rainfall. Most importantly RainTomorrow indicates whether it rained the next day.

I used these techniques to study weather patterns. They include: 
- Decision Trees
- Support Vector Machines
- Multi-layer Perception
- Gaussian Naive Bayes
- Random Forest
- Logistic RegressionCV.


Detailed analysis and conclusions are included in Machine_Learning_analysis.pdf.

Most importantly, Decision Tree and Random Forest were most effecitve and precise with accuracy of 83.11.
